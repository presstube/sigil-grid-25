# Sigil Grid 25 - Project Intentions

## Primary Goals

1. **Project Familiarization**
   - Review and understand the existing art project codebase
   - Document key components and their interactions
   - Identify the core artistic and technical elements

2. **Code Cleanup**
   - Address obvious technical debt while learning the codebase
   - Improve code organization where clearly beneficial
   - Document any non-obvious technical decisions

3. **Bundle Creation**
   - Export project as a single JavaScript file
   - Include all dependencies in the bundle
   - Incorporate the runtime-loaded asset library directly
   - Target output: `art-core-sigil-grid-25.js`

4. **Reference Implementation**
   - Use triangle-art project as a reference implementation
   - Plan to include triangle-art as a subfolder when needed
   - Study its bundling and integration approaches

5. **Integration Interface**
   - Design and implement a specific integration interface
   - Ensure compatibility with both PTree and Triangle projects
   - Define clear integration handshake requirements

## Integration Interface Considerations

Key points to address in the interface design:
- Initialization and cleanup protocols
- Asset loading and management
- State management and persistence
- Event handling and communication
- Performance and memory considerations
- Canvas/rendering context requirements

## Success Criteria

A successful project completion will deliver:
1. A single, self-contained JavaScript file (`art-core-sigil-grid-25.js`)
2. A well-defined integration interface
3. Compatibility with PTree and Triangle projects
4. Documentation of the integration process
